                In the course of events that have happened between us, I have had a string entwined with you, my breath...💕
            </br> When the course of my path is miserable, you have been the miracle torch I bear...you make me the torch bearer🥹❣
            </br> When the course of time was so harsh that it hurt me all over, you have been the only person I can count on🫂❤
            </br> When the course of my nobility was out of order, you have been the only means of my redemption✨💫
            </br> I had a picture of how a sister loves her brother and you are the walking evidence for that💗
            </br>
            </br>
                It, at times, is felt that even the shoulder which has been a strength to everyone for eternity, needs a shoulder to lie on too and you are my shoulder, my beloved sister🥹🫂❤ 
                It, always, is said that no matter where in the world you may go you'd finally reach home and if anyone asks me, I'd say I'd reach you, undoubtedly... You are one in my home, my beloved sister🥹❤🫂
            </br>
            </br>You, if I show some gestures, sometimes say that it is too much love for you to take in... Oh my lovely sister, love is all I got for you so however huge and humungous it feels for you, it'd turn out to be so small and sweet for me💖
            </br>I love you so much that your mood impacts mine...
            </br>For the sister who made her brother a noble person,
            </br>Say you are quarrelling, I'll have the other mouths shut 🔥
            </br>Say you need assistance, I'll get your job done all alone within a blink without a second thought 😊
            </br>Say you need me to keep quiet, I'll just stand straight right behind you folding my hands and❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥.......... Like a decent boy I mean to say😅😅😅
            </br>
            </br>No matter how cold the environment around you gets, I'll become the quilt you'll require ❤‍🔥🫂
            </br>No matter how rough your patch is, I'll be the cotton pillow under your head❤
            </br>No matter how dark your phase gets, I'll be the first light ray to reach you💫
            </br>I won't let the plight touch you💝🫂
            </br>
            </br>To the person who made me feel like she is raising me...
            </br>The more you try to treat me like a kid, the more I become a bigger kid😂😂😂
            </br>The more you try to rub my hair, the more I grow a forest on my head🤜🏻🤛🏻✨
            </br>Not to mention the more you try to keep your birthday simple, the grander I make it✨😂❤
            </br>
            </br>As I said, this birthday is grand... I made it grand... With this.. all I wanted to say is... I love you so much, sister❤
            </br>I wholeheartedly pray that under no circumstances, there should come a situation where you won't be able to tell me things nor should I be in a situation where I couldn't be in a position to help you...However I put you ahead of me❤
            </br>Happy birthday akkaa✨💕
